These tests are designed to test the Teleporters, as well as give back useful data to the FPGA development team. The test layers are FPGA, BP and SIP.

== platform+teleporter tests

The platform will have its own tests, robotframework expands on those by testing the integration between the platform and the teleporter.

== app+platform

The app will have its own tests, robotframework expands on those by testing the integration between the app and the platform.
