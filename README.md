# SongPark TestSuite v1.0.1

This project is a testing project that allows us to test stream quality on the Teleporter devices. The project is based on python and makes use of the audio loop back to generate and test the generated audio on a particular device. The project is able to initiate a remote testing procedure that startes a call between two Teleporters
that you desire and resord the call between the two, the audio passed between the call (the audio recorded) is generated by this test suite program as a sine wave which 
allows for simpler audio analysis.

## Installation

On the host machine (Your laptop), setup the testing enviroment by running the following commands:

1. `python3 -m venv env` to create a virtual environment 

2. `source env/bin/activate` to activate the enviroment

3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` installs required dependencies

4. `python setup_local.py` creates a [test.ini] file that you supposed to update

5. `python setup_remote.py` ensures that the remote devices are setup make sure you have updated the `test.ini` file before attempting this step

## Usage
